## Description

The Fort Forex Robot uses a grid strategy to place buy and sell orders based on certain price levels. It works as follows:

1. The input parameters for the robot can be set as follows:
   - GridSize: The size of the grid in pips.
   - Range: The price range in pips to profit from.
   - LotSize: The lot size for each order.
   - StopLoss: The stop loss in pips.

2. On each tick, the robot gets the current price of the symbol and calculates the grid levels:
   - gridLevel: The level at which the grid starts.
   - upperLevel: The upper level of the grid.
   - lowerLevel: The lower level of the grid.

3. The robot checks if there are any open positions. If there are no open positions, it places initial buy and sell orders at the current price with the specified lot size and stop loss.

4. If there are open positions, the robot checks if the current price has reached the upper or lower level. If the price has reached the upper level, it closes all buy positions and opens a new sell position. If the price has reached the lower level, it closes all sell positions and opens a new buy position.
